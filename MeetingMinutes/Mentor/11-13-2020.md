## Topics Discussed

- Software
  - Demonstrated the completed navigation and settings page
    - Small things could be included to the settings page like saving those settings values for when the app is closed and actually implement notification capability instead of only the permissions. 
  - Login page and accounts page still needed to be finished
- User Documentation
- Developement Documentation
- Deployment Documentation
- Design of app
  - Don't worry too much since it's only the first iteration and were aadding quite a bit of functionality to the app so far
  
## Things Clarified

- Software
  - We are on track, but we need to make sure that we get all our coding for the first iteration finished before the time it's due. 
- User Documentation, Developement Documentation, Deployment Documentation
  - We haven't started creating any documentation yet. 
  - Need to get started on that so we can finish it before the time it's due.
Ryland likes what we have so far and is glad we have access to the API and tools we actually need to complete iteration one.
