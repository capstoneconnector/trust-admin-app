## Topics Discussed
- Software features we added since last iteration
- Current progress

## Things Clarified / Feedback

- Likes how clean the UI looks and is not clunky 
- We should have more visual indicators of what the app is doing. 
 - For tabbed pages, we should have something to show which is the active page viewed
 - Instead of blank pages, have something showing a certain account has no data on that screen
- Thinks our error popups and reasoning for that error are fine since we don't have access to that certain data from the sdk
- Thinks the clients are really going to like it too
