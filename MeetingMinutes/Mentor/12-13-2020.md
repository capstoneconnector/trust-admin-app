## Topics Discussed
- Features added for second iteration
    - Unit tests for the search functionality, tested on suffix tree data structure that is used to parse results

    - View single accounts page, shows account details such as cash and investments. Also has an option to show files and relationships
    - Search bar, which does not make network requests, making searching faster; uses a suffix tree data structure that parses through accounts

    - Abstract search bar to be used in different parts of application
