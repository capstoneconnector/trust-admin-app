- API key and it's relation to version control
- Search functionality
- Testing
- App design and layout
- Setting up additional mentor meeting

## Things Clarified

- How we should set up the project structure for passing data through paage navigation easier
- Upgrades to existing functionality
  - Accounts page listview can now pull to refresh
- Currently working on
  - Accounts page search performance 
    - iOS can be very laggy
    - creating a suffix tree style style for the data
  - MSTest and Mock library MockMQ for unit tests
  - Seperating more code so that it can be accessed easier
- Maybe consider not having complete functinality like originally planned for accounts pages, but instead have all the pages there with the basic functionality

## Mentor Feedback

- Still waiting to try to get Apple developer accounts worked out
- We should make sure that we only promise what we can actually achieve
  - When we finish what was promised, we can add aditional functionality
- Likes what we have so far
  - Thinks it's a good idea that we evenly split up the work this time
