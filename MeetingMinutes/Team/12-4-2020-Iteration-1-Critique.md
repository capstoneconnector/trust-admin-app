##  Team: `Rating Project`
### Summary
- The project is a full-stack web app that is designed for the company EduSource
- The project goal is to supply the client with a website that allows the company to "rate" appretices on their development abilities 
### Differences Between ours and Thiers:
- Our project is a front-end only, native application designed using Xamarin for iOS and Android
- We were supplied with a .NET SDK via the client for our web requests, but this project had to create the full-stack of applications
### Suggestions:
- I would have added a signup functionality in iteration 1 because user registration is the foundation of every user focused web app
- I would have reversed the order of the rating history to have the newest rating be at the top of the list
##  Team: `Lead Sigma`
### Summary
- They are creating a full-stack application so that a sales rep can login and view and edit information about their leads. 
- Their main service they are creating is an API that their client will use for other services of his.
### Differences Between ours and Thiers:
- Our project only deals with the front-end, where as theirs is full-stack.
- Their styling seemed to be more in-depth than ours was.
- They implemented Docker functionality and unit testing
### Suggestions:
- Smooth out the litle design details like on the dashboard, it looks a little weird how there is a lot off empty space on the side before you click on the view button.
- I didn't see a way to logout easily, and that is a something that should definitely be there easy to find.

## Team `Betterflye Mobile`

### Summary
Betterflye is a company that allows users to track their social impact with voluntary sign-up initiatives. The students in this capstone group are tasked with coming up with a mobile solution for Betterflye that allows this functionality. For the first iteration, the group has the login and the sign-up functionality implemented. 

### Main Differences
- While our projects are both mobile apps, they are developing theirs in the Dart programming language. For ours, we are using Xamarin, which uses C#/.NET
- In their first iteration, their feature was a single page that displayed a QR code linked to the user's account. In ours, we have a settings page and an account page that displays the list of accounts for the administrator
- In their project, users have the ability to sign up (i.e. set up a new account with a custom username/password). This is not used in our app, as the administrators of the company manually add credentials for approved users

### Suggestions for improvement
- The sign-up page is impressive, but maybe next time dedicate more functionality to users who are already logged in
- Maybe add more styling to the QR code page, and to all future pages that user sees when they log in.
