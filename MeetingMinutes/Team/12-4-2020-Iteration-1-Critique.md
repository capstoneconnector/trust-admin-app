##  Team: `Rating Project`
### Summary
- The project is a full-stack web app that is designed for the company EduSource
- The project goal is to supply the client with a website that allows the company to "rate" appretices on their development abilities 
### Differences Between ours and Thiers:
- Our project is a front-end only, native application designed using Xamarin for iOS and Android
- We were supplied with a .NET SDK via the client for our web requests, but this project had to create the full-stack of applications
### Suggestions:
- I would have added a signup functionality in iteration 1 because user registration is the foundation of every user focused web app
- I would have reversed the order of the rating history to have the newest rating be at the top of the list
##  Team: `Lead Sigma`
### Summary
- They are creating a full-stack application so that a sales rep can login and view and edit information about their leads. 
- Their main service they are creating is an API that their client will use for other services of his.
### Differences Between ours and Thiers:
- Our project only deals with the front-end, where as theirs is full-stack.
- Their styling seemed to be more in-depth than ours was.
- They implemented Docker functionality and unit testing
### Suggestions:
- Smooth out the litle design details like on the dashboard, it looks a little weird how there is a lot off empty space on the side before you click on the view button.
- I didn't see a way to logout easily, and that is a something that should definitely be there easy to find.
