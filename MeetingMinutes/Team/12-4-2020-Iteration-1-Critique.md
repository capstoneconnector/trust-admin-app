##  Team: `Rating Project`
### Summary
- The project is a full-stack web app that is designed for the company EduSource
- The project goal is to supply the client with a website that allows the company to "rate" appretices on their development abilities 
### Differences Between ours and Thiers:
- Our project is a front-end only, native application designed using Xamarin for iOS and Android
- We were supplied with a .NET SDK via the client for our web requests, but this project had to create the full-stack of applications
### Suggestions:
- I would have added a signup functionality in iteration 1 because user registration is the foundation of every user focused web app
- I would have reversed the order of the rating history to have the newest rating be at the top of the list
