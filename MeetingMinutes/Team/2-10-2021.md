## Topics Discussed
- Division of labor for fourth iteration
- Features remaining for future iterations
- UI testing


## Things clarified
- Everyone will work in a similar area from the previous iteration in the current iteration to avoid learning curves, and because data types will be relatively the same
- E.g. Clayton will work in posting relationships, Michael will work in posting tasks and activities, etc.
- Not many features left to implement, will have a future discussion on what can be added for final iteration
- Everyone will help to implement UI testing for fourth iteration. Possibly might need to expand beyond current testing framework, but group will work together to find a solution that ensures adequate testing for user interface.
