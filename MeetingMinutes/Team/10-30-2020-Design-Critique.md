##  Team: `Merit Engine`
### Differences Between ours and Thiers:
- Their prototype was a simple 1 page design, while ours focused on the flow of the application along with the overall deisn aspects
- The TechStack was much smaller than ours despite working for the same company and with the same mentor
- The presentation seemed more geared towards someone who knew the issue and the systems that were at play for the project, rather than for introducing us to the project, while ours tried to gear towards someone who doesn't know anything about it.
### Suggestions:
- Remake the prototype to show the flow of the application in order to give a more solid foundation of what the program does
- Have the TechStack include Tech that may be necessary even if it may NOT be used (better to be safe)
- Be more organized for the presentation of the information (everything felt improvised)
- Establish a more solid framework of restrictions (requirements, business requirements, domain model, etc) for yourself to hold yourself to a higher quality of work
- Explain why the Tech Stack is being used in the project in some capacity because, currently, we see no need for MySQL
## Team: `Automated Access Control`
### Summary
The automated access Control project is a product known as the Zooom app made by 
TyrosLLC that was created in 2015. It is a producer of sports officiating products. The application
has a number of different paid services that it offers, and those interactions are going to be refined
by the capstone students.  
### Differences Between ours and Theirs:
- Their application needs support for administrators as well as normal users whereras ours is just for administrators. (Domain Model)
- The application makes use of a payment system and ours doesn't require any payments because it's an "in-house" app just 
for our clients and not their clients. (Preparations)
- Their techstack makes use of a full backend for ASP.NET as well as using Azure SQL Server. Ours makes use of 
our clients pre-existing APIs so we don't need to work full stack. (TechStack)
### Suggestions:
- First iteration is pretty good, but could be a little too much. (Dependent on forward speed of progress) Maybe take it down to 3 instead of 4 features.
- The business requirements are very specific and need to be more general and/or higher level. 
##  Team: `Eve`
### Summary
The Eve app is a place for businesses connect with each other. You will be able to sign up as a mentor or a sponsor. You can access resources like educational videos or conferences. There will also be an assistant named Eve that can help you with information or inquiries.
### Differences Between ours and Theirs:
- Their application was full stack compared to ours which is mainly just the frontend.
- Their technologies in their tech stack are very different from ours.
- They actually got to choose which technologies they can use, where as my group was just told what we were going to use by our client.
### Suggestions:
- The concept of the assistant Eve was a little confusing. It sounds like a virtual assistant to help with questions but there was not a place in the domain model or prototype for it. That should be clarified more.
- For the prototype, it looks like they only took into consideration the first iteration features. There should be pages of the other information so that we have an idea about what that would look like too.
- In the prototype, the information screen when you try to sign up should be presented somewhere before you click the sign up button. Most people would like to know what the program is about and probably would not even try to sign up if they do not know what it is about.
