## Things clarified
- Merging branches/Resolving Conflicts
	- After some struggle, we managed to resolve the merging issues between the different branches and make a complete whole develop branch
	- Some of these problems included the Search Bar functionality breaking for seemingly no reason, and the android project not building correctly when merging in the tests
	- This was the bulk of the meeting
- Solving build issues for Android Project
	- When attempting to make an apk file to put on his phone for testing, Christo changed some settings which broke when merging into the testing branch. Resetting these fixed it
- Documentation Updating
