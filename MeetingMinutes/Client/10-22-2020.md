## Things clarified
- we should use their design team to help with the UI design
- Clarified that the prototype was only for flow purposes, not design
- Cheetah api consists of list > search> single item flow pattern
- The reviews tab of our prototype is actually a bonus, not part of the specifications given by clients
- Going through checklist to see if anything missing in prototype
  - Save for last, filter reviews/approvals by person
  - Use dummy data in place for that functionality for now

We had recorded a youtube video of our prototype flow to show to Linc and Iris last week when we finished the prototype. Which worked out great because we learned that they have a team dedicated to design and they were wanting to show their design team and help our capstone group with it. In this meeting, we basically just went through each page and showed them every interaction in the prototype. Iris even went back through our requirements and compared it to our prototype and saw that we had included everything from the requirements in our prototype. They both really seemed to like the flow and said how they were impressed on how we actually had the flow for all of the specifications plus more parts they could build on in the future.
We then went through the rest of our design materials as they were interested in seeing and made sure everything was up to their desires.
