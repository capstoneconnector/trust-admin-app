# Business Requirements

## -**BR1:** Application Type
This application is intended to be an on-the-go solution for administrators to look up essential information regarding customers on the Cheetah portal without having to log into the desktop version of Cheetah. Given the possible need for use of system resources, this eliminates the possibility of using a web application designed for mobile devices. Therefore, this shall be a native mobile application that is not accessible to desktop machines, and it will only be capable of the basic tasks defined in the following requirements.

## -**BR2:** Operating System

This application shall only be available for the iOS and Android operating systems. This is being included as a business requirement because it is explicitly stated on documentation from the client. The application is also only meant to be an on-the-go option for administrators, and as such, does not need to be made available for desktop computers. This will make it more convenient for adminstrators to attend to customers, and therefore, to successfully satisfy the customers' needs and attract new customers.

 ## -**BR3:** Access

This application and its functions shall be accessible only to administrators who belong to the client, and excluded from anyone else. This is a business requirement because it is crucial for administrators to have access to these tools on-the-go so that they may always have up-to-date information about their customers, which will therefore allow administrators to service them even in a situation that is not conducive to using a desktop computer. It is also important that anyone else be excluded, as the application will have access to sensitive customer information. The information accessible to the administrators through this application is shown in the following requirements.

## -**BR4:** Account Info

This application shall provide access to a customer's account information, which consists of a high level portfolio view, cash from income and principal, the account's market value, relationships with addresses listed along with support for Google Maps/Waze, customer documents, and a limited transaction history of the client. This is a business requirement because it is listed on the client's documentation, with the reason being that the administrator must have access about relevant account details to communicate information to the client, which could include information about the customer's finances that could affect the client's repuation.

## -**BR5:** Tasks

This application shall allow administrators access to their daily tasks, which includes the ability to resolve and dismiss a task, as well as push notifications for any given task. This is a business requirement because it is essential that administrators have access to their tasks even while not in a sit-down setting. Some of these tasks might be time sensitive, and whether they are completed successfully or not can affect a customer's view of the client, and hence, can affect the client's attractiveness to prospective customers.

## -**BR6:** Activities

This application shall have the ability to create new activities, which are past tense records that can include completed tasks. This is a business requirement because an administrator might need access to past records for a particular customer that has relevant information for them, such as account activity, that a customer might need to know before making future decisions that affect their account. The ability to access and manipulate these records on-the-go is important to delivering a solutions for customers.

## -**BR7:** Approval

This application shall be able to approve items and use push notifications to notify administrators of items whose approval is pending. This is a business requirement because administrators must be able to approve items while on-the-go, as the timing and speed of the approval can have implications for the quality of the solution that the client provides to its customers.
