# User Documentation
## Getting Started
For iOS users, when you open the app for the first time it will ask you to allow permission for notifications. We strongly encourage you to allow these so you can be notified through the app for any reviews. For Android devices, there is no need to allow notifications since it's already allowed by default.

After that, the app will load up to the login page. This is where you will enter in your user credentials that you use for Cheetah and then tap the login button.

## Navigating the App
Once you are logging in, it is really simple to navigate the app. We utilized a navigation bar on the bottom of the page. Some buttons on that navigation bar include accounts, reviews, assignments, and settings. To navigate to those different pages, all you have to to is tap on the correlating button for that page.
